    <p><b> How does age affect the impact of covid cases? (Mortality rate, number of deaths)</b></p>

    <p>The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italy has hit mostly people over 50 years of age. Also, the virus claimed
        approximately 32 thousand lives since it entered the country between the end of January and the beginning of
        February 2020. As the chart shows, mortality rate appeared to be higher for the elderly patient. In fact, for
        people between 80 and 89 years of age, the mortality rate was almost 32 percent. For patients older than 90
        years this figure was 28.5 percent. Overall, the mortality rate of coronavirus in Italy reached 13.7 percent,
        higher than that registered in other countries. Italians over the age of 70 represents more than 87% deaths.</p>

    <p>The spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italy has hit mostly people over 50 years of age. In fact, as the
        chart shows, 70 percent of individuals infected with the virus was over 50 years old. Only one in four
        individuals who contracted the virus were between 19 and 50 years old</p>

    <p> <b> Does covid have different effects on males and females?</b> </p>
    <img class="i" src="{{url_for('static',filename='images/b4.PNG')}}" alt="">
    <p>After the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italy, many people died after contracting the infection. An
        in depth study on 30 thousand coronavirus deaths revealed that the fatality rate is much higher for men. In
        fact, if the mortality rate for female patients was 9.9 percent, the figure for male patients was 17.4 percent,
        nearly twice as high. The chart shows how this gap was recorded among all age groups. More than 70% of Italy
        coronavirus deaths have been among men.
        At least 3,400 people in the Italy have died of devastating disease and it is announced, it had a higher deaths
        toll than China . But less than 1,000 of them have been women.
        Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the first place and account of 60 %

    <img class="i" src="{{url_for('static',filename='images/b5.PNG')}}" alt="">
    <p>From the above graphs we observe that, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.
        Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion,
        headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of
        fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have
        very mild symptoms. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
        difficulty breathing. </p><br>

    <p>The percentage of recovery after confirmation is 61.11555830121205%</p>

    <p><b>Are patients in intensive care unit and death rate correlated?</b></p>
    <img class="i" src="{{url_for('static',filename='images/b14.PNG')}}" alt="">
    <p>Italy has the highest fatalities due to coronavirus. On March 9, Italy extended the lockdown from certain areas
        to the whole country when it had more than 5000 confirmed coronavirus cases, out of which 733 were in intensive
        care and 463 were dead because of the virus. As we can see death of patients are started from mid or late Feb
        but from 15 March count of deaths is increasing monotonously which is terrifying for country to face. Meanwhile,
        for intensive care unit count of patients is at its peak between 22 March to 12 April and decreasing after 12
        April.
        As we can see the that patients in intensive care and deaths are moderately correlated
        cor (data$IntensiveCarePatients,data$Deaths)=0.6245294 (this is the numeric value of the
        correlation)

            (according to its deaths and positive patients)</b></p>
    <img id="r" class="i" src="{{url_for('static',filename='images/b15.PNG')}}" alt="">
    <p>For Death cases - Italy is most affected country among all we are considering. After Italy, Spain and France had
        high mortality rate. We can see for Italy its rapidly increasing after 19 March and its monotonously increasing
        after 23 March for Spain.
        What is more noticeable is death rate is low in Germany and very low in India compare to other countries. As for
        now we are considering cases only up to 14th May 2020.

    <br>
    <p><b>Observation</b></p>
    <p>For Confirmed positive cases in 5 countries - India, Italy, Spain, France and Germany
        As we can see by the start of February 2020 all above mentioned countries had started detecting corona patients.
        From 15 March to 20 April, all countries had rapid growth of virus that is increasing number of corona patients
        except India, for India, thereâ€™s slow increment.
        Italy was one of the most affected country but between 27th March to 31st March, it steps back as Spain had
        sudden rise.
        As we can see from 8 May, it is getting steadier for all countries meanwhile India had monotonous increment
        after 2 April 2020 but very low compare to other 4 countries.
